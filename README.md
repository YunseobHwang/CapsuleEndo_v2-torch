# Introduction

CNN-based small bowel lesion classification and XAI-based localization

- DL Platform conversion Tensorflow to Pytorch
- Jupyter notebooks for understanding in each phase and code modularization for usability
- Separte model development and video analysis
- Including experiments for master's thesis (Yunseob Hwang - Convolutional Neural Network Based Small Bowel Lesion Detection in Capsule Endoscopy, POSTECH, 2021)
